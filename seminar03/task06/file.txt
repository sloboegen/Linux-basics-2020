A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire,
one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage,
Minato Namikaze (with his wife Uzumaki Kushina) seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son,
Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;
this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become leader
of Konoha again. Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails.
Because of a decree made by the Third Hokage forbidding anyone to mention these events,
Naruto knows nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja,
reveals the truth to Naruto.
Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher Iruka Umino.
